# Getting Started

First of all we are going to need some software

Here is a list of applications you will need to help you make a beatsaber mod:

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (I will be using visual studio code in this tutorial)

[Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads)

[Andriod ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

[Quest Package Manager](https://github.com/sc2ad/questpackagemanager)

### Once we have that we need a template to start a project:

We are going to use: [LaurieTheFish's Template](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template)

# Setup
<a id="setup"></a>

First of all you are going to need to download this template and then extract it into a folder called something like `my-new-mod` make sure there are no spaces in the name otherwise this will cause issues with ndk when you try to build your mod.

Download it as a zip and extract it, you now need to copy the contents of the "template" folder into your new mod folder

**Tip: you can use `ctrl+a` to select everything in a folder**

Once you have copied it your folder should look something like this...
