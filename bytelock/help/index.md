## 1: ByteCoins

This is a form of currency used in this game people store their "ByteCoins" On servers, ByteCoins can also be expressed as "≈Å"

## 2: Servers

Servers can be used to run code.
For every core on a server you can run 100 processes but RAM depends on the contents of the code the script editor will tell you how much RAM a script will use while you are writing it

## 3: Hacking Skill

You have a hacking skill, this increases by `+0.01` everytime you hack a server and you will also gain the money that was stored on that server.

## 4: Terminal

This is the tab that allows you to interact with your servers, you can switch servers by going to the server tab and pressing the IP Adress of the server or by running the `connect < ip >` command

For more information on this refer to: https://docs.phazed.xyz/bytelock/os

## 5: Script Editor

If you like coding, this is where you will be spending most of your time! Here you can edit scripts and save them to your server.

You can make a new script or open an existing script by using the `nano < filename >` command!
